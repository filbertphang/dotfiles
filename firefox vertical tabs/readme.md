# firefox vertical tabs

from https://codeberg.org/ranmaru22/firefox-vertical-tabs, with very minor modifications
(i've attached a copy of it here because this addon is so important to me that i literally need a backup.
all credits go to ranmaru22. i do not claim any credit for this.)

requires: tab center reborn

- `userChrome.css` goes in `chrome/userChrome.css` after you navigate to `about:profiles` in firefox and click "open root directory" on the default profile
- the contents of `tab-center-reborn-custom-stylesheet.css` goes into the "custom stylesheet" section in your tab center reborn options
